[{"content":"Liver regeneration plays a crucial role in repairing liver injury caused by APAP overdose. Various cell types are involved in the complex processes of liver regeneration, however, the underlying mechanism of liver regeneration remains poorly understood. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing at different time point during APAP-induced liver injury to shed light on the mechanisms of liver regeneration.\n","date":"2024-09-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://l7991-lian.github.io/p/apap-and-liver-regeneration/resume_logo_hu16672595683230234927.jpg","permalink":"https://l7991-lian.github.io/p/apap-and-liver-regeneration/","title":"APAP and liver regeneration"},{"content":" I am Li Jinlian, a dedicated researcher currently pursuing an advanced academic degree at the esteemed Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, which is a constituent of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
